GitHub is a web-based platform primarily used for version control and collaborative software development. It uses Git, a distributed version control system, which allows multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other's changes. GitHub hosts repositories, making it easier to share code, track revisions, and collaborate on open-source projects.
