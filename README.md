GitHub is a web-based platform primarily used for version control and collaborative software development. It uses Git, a distributed version control system, which allows multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other's changes. GitHub hosts repositories, making it easier to share code, track revisions, and collaborate on open-source projects.

Some key features of GitHub include:

Repositories: Where project code is stored and managed.
Branches: Allow developers to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Pull Requests (PRs): Propose changes to the main project, which can be reviewed and merged by other collaborators.
Issues: For tracking bugs, feature requests, or any tasks related to the project.
Actions: For automating workflows like continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
GitHub Pages: A service to host static websites directly from a repository.
Collaboration: Tools like discussions, code reviews, and project management help teams work together efficiently.
GitHub is widely used not only for code management but also for documentation, community engagement, and even project management within the broader software development ecosystem. It's a central hub for open-source projects and has a large, active community that contributes to countless libraries, frameworks, and tools.
